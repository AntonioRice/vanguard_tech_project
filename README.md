# Vanguard-Tech

VT Is a full-stack mobile-responsive web application that promotes student engagement through a student driven challenge/rewards system. Teachers will provide challenges for student body.  Students will be able to accept and complete challenges.  Once a challenge is completed a student will be awarded points.
